Suicide is recognised as a public health priority by the World Health Organisation, as over 700,000 people die annually due to suicide . It is a problem that is not unique to high-income countries (where there is a well-established link with mental disorders) but also affects low- and middle-income countries (where many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses). Suicide mortality rate is one of the indicators of target 3.4 of the Sustainable Development Goals: by 2030, which is to reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases.
